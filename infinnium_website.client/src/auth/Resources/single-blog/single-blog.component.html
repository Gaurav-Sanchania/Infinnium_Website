      <p>
          Over the past five years, Infinnium has mindfully grown their leadership team to bring their battle-tested and innovative suite of data governance tools to the market.  The addition of Elie Francis adds depth and added focus to this growth orientation.  In October 2024, the company also announced that Doug Kaminski, another recognized industry leader, joined as Chief Revenue Officer.
      </p>
      <p>
          ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to be working with this world class team to bring our new approach to common data challenges to a broader audience,‚Äù said Elie Francis.  ‚ÄúFor too long, the legal ecosystem has been trying to solve Information Governance and Data Privacy problems using legacy eDiscovery tools that require the movement of data.

I am extremely excited to join such impressive team with an even more impressive and capable software platform.‚Äù
