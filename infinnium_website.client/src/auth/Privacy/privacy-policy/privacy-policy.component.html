    PRIVACY POLICY
</p>
<p class="px-4 sm:px-8 md:px-16 lg:px-24 xl:px-32 text-justify" style="font-family: 'Manrope', 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
    <b>SCOPE</b><br>
    This Privacy Statement applies to all Infinnium-owned websites, domains, and services and those of our wholly owned
    subsidiaries (“Infinnium sites or services”), except that a privacy policy or statement specific to a particular
    Infinnium service or program may supersede or supplement this Privacy Statement. Personal information concerning
    Infinnium and its customers, including outsourcing and other services clients, business partners, employees, former
    employees, and applicants for employment (“covered individuals”) collected and processed offline is also governed by
    this Privacy Statement except where the contract with a covered individual defines different requirements which will
    take precedence over this Privacy Statement. <br><br>

    This Privacy Statement also provides notice as set out in the requirements of certification to the EU-U.S. Data
    Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
    (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, hereto collectively also referred to as the DPF,
    of which Infinnium is a participant. <br><br>

    You will find further information on the DPF in the Data Privacy Framework section of this Policy <br><br>

    <b>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
    Personal information is any information that personally identifies a natural person or from which a natural person
    could be identified. This may include a name, address, telephone number, email address and other private personal
    attributes.
    Infinnium collects, uses, stores and transfers (collectively “processes”) Personal Information to manage its
    relationship with its customers, employees, business partners and other third parties (“covered individuals”) and
    better serve covered individuals by personalizing their experience and interaction with Infinnium. Such processing
    is done in compliance with applicable laws, including appropriate notice and consent, along with required filings
    with data protection authorities, where required.
    Infinnium may collect and process Personal Information through a variety of means when a covered individual
    purchases or receives services from Infinnium, asks for information about Infinnium or its services, applies for
    employment with Infinnium, or engages with Infinnium for any reason, including partaking in promotional and
    informational events. Such interactions may occur through email, technical and online forums and tools including
    webinars hosted by Infinnium, through hiring and employment processes, through the employment application process,
    and through verbal and virtual interactions with Infinnium personnel. <br><br>

    Infinnium may receive, or be directed to collect, personal information from data controller-clients in connection
    with Infinnium’s provision of litigation support other consulting services to those data controller-clients. In such
    instances, Infinnium acts at the direction of the data controller-client, provided that such directions are not
    inconsistent with the DPF principles or other applicable law, regulation or corporate policy. <br>
    In the provisioning of these services Infinnium may receive personal information of individuals residing in the
    European Union (“EU”), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom when it does business with data controller-clients that
    possess personal information. <br><br>

    <b>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
    Fulfilling your Transaction Request
    If we receive any requests related to, for example, a service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will
    use your Personal Information to fulfil your request. In this context, we may share information with others, for
    instance, Infinnium’s group companies and business partners, involved in the fulfilment of your request. In
    connection with a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market
    research purposes subject to applicable laws and regulations.
    Personalizing your Experience on our Websites <br><br>
    We may use information we collect about you to provide you with a personalized experience on our websites, such as
    providing you with content in which you may be interested and making navigation on our sites easier. <br><br>

    <b>Providing Support</b><br>
    We may use your Personal Information to support Infinnium products or services you have purchased from us. This data
    may contain information about you, your organization’s employees, customers, partners, or suppliers (collectively
    “customer data”). This Privacy Statement does not apply to our access to or handling of your customer data; the
    conditions regarding the handling and processing of your customer data is covered by the applicable terms of use or
    other agreements between you and Infinnium and its group companies. <br><br>

    <b>Marketing </b><br>
    The information you provide to Infinnium, as well as the information we have lawfully collected about you
    indirectly, may be used by Infinnium for marketing purposes. We will offer you the opportunity to opt-in to
    Infinnium marketing using your information in this way. You may at any time choose not to receive marketing

    <b>CHOICES AND PRIVACY PREFERENCES</b><br>
    Registration is not required to gain access to Infinnium websites. However, Infinnium may offer specific material
    and information where your subscription is required.
    In this scenario, Infinnium may collect Personal Information from you including your name, phone number, email
    address, or other information you choose to provide at various times, for example, when you complete an online form
    or request or participate in an online community.
    You can make or change your choices about receiving either subscription or general communications at the data
    collection point, within your account preference settings or by using other methods, which are listed in this
    Privacy Statement. You may opt-out at any time using the links at the bottom of any email or by emailing Infinnium’s
    Global Privacy and Data Protection Office at privacy&#64;Infinnium.com.
    Please note, this option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering business
    relationships, including contracts, support, or other administrative and transactional notices where the primary
    purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature. <br><br>

    Infinnium will work in good faith with individuals whose personal information it receives under the DPF that are
    interested in exercising their right to choose whether their personal information (a) will be disclosed to a third
    party or (b) used for a purpose that is materially different – or in the case of sensitive information, different –

    including but not limited to employment-related activities, it will offer individuals the opportunity to choose
    (specifically, opt out of) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or
    (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized
    by the individual. For sensitive information, Infinnium will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and
    explicitly provide consent (specifically, opt in) to (a) the disclosure of the information to a third party or (b)
    the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or
    subsequently authorized by the individual. Infinnium will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise
    their choices should requisite circumstances arise. Questions regarding this section should be directed to the
