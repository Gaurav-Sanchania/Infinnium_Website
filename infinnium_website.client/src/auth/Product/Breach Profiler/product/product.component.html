            Infinnium BreachProfiler™ has capabilities in the breach review domain that are unparalleled and distinctly unique. The solution offers the flexibility of on-site deployment, ensuring data remains within the client’s premises, or securely captured by incident response teams for ingestion into the platform.Unlike SaaS-based competitors, BreachProfiler™ is not a hosted service—so data never leaves your environment. Whether deployed on-site or securely captured by incident response teams, 4iG® ensures that your breached data remains securely within your control. This eliminates the need to send sensitive information to third parties, reducing the risk of exposure and providing peace of mind that your data is safe throughout the review process.  If you prefer to use it via a service provider, we have a network of trusted partners that host BreachProfiler™ and can provide our technology to suit your needs.

            Most importantly, BreachProfiler™ is battle tested and trusted by some of the largest providers of data breach reviews in the world.  We have clients processing terabytes of source data every day with ease, and others managing more than 750 million records within a single data “space” inside the platform.  While other platforms often charge extra when large volumes of structured PII are detected within a single file as well as high monthly hosting costs, 4iG® treats all data equally. There are no hidden upcharges based on the complexity of your data, ensuring predictable costs regardless of the breach’s size or structure
