    <b>COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</b><br>
    A cookie is a file containing a string of information that a web site saves on a visitor’s computer. The visitor’s
    browser provides this file to the web site operator each time the visitor returns to the information collecting
    website. When Infinnium collects cookies or makes use of a browser’s local storage capabilities, they help Infinnium
    identify visitors, their usage of the site, and their website access preferences. Infinnium may also use information
    derived from cookies or local storage to personalize the visitor’s experience by directing the visitor to
    information marketing services that may be of interest to the visitor based on their previous website interactions.
    Visitors will be offered the opportunity to control cookie placement. Visitors who do not wish to have any cookies
    placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Infinnium’s website, with the
    drawback that certain features of the web site may not function properly without the aid of cookies. <br>
    Some browsers provide the ability to communicate that they do not wish to be tracked while browsing the internet.
    California law requires companies disclose how do-not-track requests are treated. There is no commercially uniform
    definition of what “do-not-track” means or how “do-not-track” should be measured or evaluated. Infinnium’s website
    does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated “do-not-track” signals. This does not impact website user’s
    cookie control, which can be managed as described in the previous paragraph. <br>
    Pages on Infinnium’s website may occasionally embed content from third party sites. Infinnium’s website also allows
    for content to be shared through social networks but only at your request. Embedding and sharing content may result
    in additional cookies being set by those third-party sites. Infinnium does not control the dissemination of
    third-party cookies. Please visit these third-party sites and review their privacy and cookie policies if you wish
    to learn more about their use of cookies and similar tools.
